CDR Tests Report

1 First Load Test:

1.1 Results:
        as expected
1.2 Considerations:
        (In case of web request)
        After each trending section loads from web, data is written back to database in section batches
        and after each batch a callback to CDR is given.
        And further Operation Initiater and Registered Adapter get the data via callback in same batch fashion.

        Else data will be summitted at once from data base and ActionCompleted Callback at last.

1.3 Bugs:

1.4 Solved:
