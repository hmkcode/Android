CDR Tests Report

1 First Load Test:

1.1 Results:
        as expected
1.2 Considerations:
        (In case of web request)
        After each trending section loads from web, data is written back to database in section batches
        and after each batch a callback to CDR is given.
        And further Operation Initiater and Registered Adapter get the data via callback in same batch fashion.

        Else data will be summitted at once from data base and ActionCompleted Callback at last.

1.3 Bugs:
       1.3.1  >> while loading from database only the first type is passed and rest songs of other type is included
        under first category

        [solution] : send data from database section by section (not at a time)


        >> Data get wiped out after every load


1.4 Solved:
            1.3.1 [Solved]

2 Restore test

2.1 Results
           reads the last loaded type and accordingly reads particular type from db and sumbit it via callback

 2.2 Considerations

           Submits data and at once via callback to CDR and same back to adapter via callback
           and finally a callback to ActionCompleted to Operation Initiater

 2.4 Solved:

3 Search Test

 3.1 Results

           after writing back the search term to SP and initiating the process by submitting to CDR.
           results are submitted to adapter at once and a ActionCompleted Callback to parent.

 3.2 Considerations

           Results are submitted at once so we need to clear off the previous data from adapters list and
           re-fill with the new one.

 3.3 Bugs:

 3.4 Solved


4 Refress

 4.1 Results

        After Having a refress , results loaded are same as of last loaded but they are re-requested data.

 4.2 Considerations

       For Search Results data submition to adapter is good enough as previous data is cleared before setting
        new data,

        But for Trending Result, since data are submitted in section wised batches
        we need to keep the previous batches stored or say appended.
